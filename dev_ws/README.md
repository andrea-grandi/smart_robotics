# Development Workspace â€“ R2D2 Project

This repository contains the ROS 2 workspace for the **R2D2 project**.  
The workspace follows the standard **colcon/ament** build structure.

## ðŸ“‚ Workspace Structure

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ build/        # Temporary build files (generated by colcon)
â”œâ”€â”€ install/      # Installed executables, libraries, and setup files
â”œâ”€â”€ log/          # Logs from builds and runtime
â””â”€â”€ src/          # Source code of ROS 2 packages
    â””â”€â”€ r2d2/     # Main package for the R2D2 robot
```

### **1. `src/`**
- Contains the **source code** of all ROS 2 packages.
- In this project:
  - `r2d2/` â†’ The main package with nodes, launch files, URDF/Xacro models, and configuration.

---

### **2. `build/`**
- Generated automatically when running:
  ```bash
  colcon build
  ```
- Stores **intermediate compilation artifacts** (object files, CMake/ament build files).
- Can be safely deleted and rebuilt.

---

### **3. `install/`**
- Contains the **compiled executables and libraries**.
- Provides environment setup scripts:
  ```bash
  source install/setup.bash
  ```
- Used to run nodes and launch files.

---

### **4. `log/`**
- Stores logs generated during builds and runtime:
  - Build logs (`colcon` output)
  - ROS 2 launch logs
- Useful for debugging and troubleshooting.

## ðŸš€ Build Instructions

1. Navigate to the workspace root:
   ```bash
   cd <workspace>
   ```

2. Build with `colcon`:
   ```bash
   colcon build --symlink-install
   ```

3. Source the setup file:
   ```bash
   source install/setup.bash
   ```

4. Run your nodes or launch files:
   ```bash
   ros2 launch r2d2 <launch_file>.launch.py
   ```

---

## ðŸ›  Notes
- `build/`, `install/`, and `log/` are **auto-generated** â†’ usually excluded from version control (`.gitignore`).
- Only `src/` should be tracked in the repository.
